Hi, I'm Charlotte Trible and I just wanna build cool shit.

I'm a front-end web developer in Kansas City, with particular interests in performance, maintainable codebases, a11y, and animation. Outside of my day job I make small, weird [games](https://espiongames.itch.io/), which led me to co-found and organize a local indie game development community called [Flyover Indies](https://flyoverindies.party/). I dabble in hardware and electronics, and will happily nerd out about mechanical keyboards, modding Gameboys, and homemade arcade cabinets.

As for this blog, it's probably going to be about all that stuff, but we'll see. This is my little corner of the internet, where I can write about whatever I'm interested in at that particular moment. Maybe you'll also find it interesting, or even helpful. Or maybe not, that's ok too.
