        I've always been drawn to technology and computers, particularly when
        they pose a challenge to be solved. I first got started with web
        development when I was a teenager â€“ I even remember writing pseudo-code
        in a paper notebook while on vacation very far away from my computer.
        Since then I've fixed countless computers as a certified technician,
        created many video-games as a fun hobby and co-founded Flyover Indies (a
        Kansas City area indie game developer community), and led the
        development of high traffic, delightful websites that truly are all fun
        and games (including a Webby award winner!).

        Tackling interesting problems and devising solutions brings me joy,
        which is why I love software engineering. I'm passionate about code that
        is clear, clean, and consistent. I care deeply about mentoring other
        engineers and learning from them, delivering on business priorities
        while balancing technical needs, and serving end-users with an amazing
        experience. I'm open-minded and adaptable, thrive in a cross functional
        and collaborative environment, and am not afraid of diving into
        something unknown or ambiguous.

        My ideal tech stack includes React (particularly Next.js), SCSS Modules,
        code quality tools (like ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier), Jest and
        Playwright tests, Storybook documentation, and CI/CD integration via
        GitHub Actions. That said, the opportunity to learn new things is always
        exciting and I'm a pretty quick study.
